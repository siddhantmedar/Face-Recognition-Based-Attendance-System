Every individual has distinctive facial features and can be used to identify a person. Our project aims at automating the existing attendance systems and introduces more transparency in the process of managing attendance records.

This system achieves near real-time rates using image processing algorithms. The facial-extraction is studied and best accurate features are introduced which are useful for training and testing the dataset. The system model is then used to make a prediction based on the features extracted. The proposed system detects various objects in a given frame such as human face which reveals that the proposed system is trained and tested on standard as well as custom dataset and gives excellent performance. 

On successful detection of human face, our system would verify if the face is present in the dataset and if the match is found, then the system will mark the person as present. In occasion of detection of unknown face, our system would display ‘unknown’ to indicate the person has not registered. The attendance record is stored in excel format. The attendance report is generated at the end and this report can be sent over e-mail to any entity as and when required.
